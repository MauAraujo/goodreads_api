She's one of the nurses who are fighting the coronavirus relentlessly these days. One of many, she says with humility. That's why she asks not to have a name or surname. It would be too much of a protagonist, she says. She works on two fronts: attending to the homeless, who are especially vulnerable, and then, always running, almost out of breath, going to a hospital to fight Covid-19. On the front line and without rest. That's what she's been hired to do. The first health worker to die in Spain of coronavirus was a nurse at the hospital in Galdakao (Biscay).

Coronavirus decimates health professionals: "They're dropping so much"

To deal with the epidemic on a specially equipped floor of a public hospital in Madrid, Spain's worst-hit city. "Like so many of my colleagues. It has no merit," he says. She's a little girl from the North, capable of putting up with anything. Vocational and dedicated. Used to temporary contracts. To give everything in short times, but intense. Today she is broken. She tells it in first person to Vozp√≥puli. Verbalizing everything that she is feeling, living and suffering, she confesses, has helped her in therapy.

The alarm clock rings...

The alarm clock rings. I have the feeling of having slept little and badly, as if since this madness began every day were the same. Like I'm living a bad dream.

The coffee in my kitchen tastes like glory, like it's the perfect potion that will give me enough energy for my shift. I know it's the only thing that's going to get into my body until I get home. I've also had a closed stomach for days now. No desire to eat. On 24-hour alert. No rest.

I sing very loudly, as if I could win by singing; I feel powerful with my voice, the opposite of what I feel when I cross the doors of the plant

I get in the car and drive to the hospital on empty, lonely streets, with hardly any noise. I put on music, very loud and sing very loud, as if I could win by singing; I feel powerful with my voice, the opposite of what I feel when I walk through the doors of the plant. Music always saves, and heals, even a poor nurse who is fooled into thinking that this morning will be better.

You know that the situation can get to you, that you do what you can, that you prioritize care and that this is extremely painful

I arrive at the plant and I see the faces of my colleagues at night, exhausted from the shift and from the weeks we have been working non-stop. The same thing is repeated every day, a fight against time and without rest to take good care of our patients, but you know that the situation can get to you, that you do what you can, that you prioritize care and that this is extremely painful.

You have to be in the rooms as little as possible, because the workload does not allow it, and because with a PID you have to spend a limited time

I'm not going to tell you what you already know, PID (Personal Protective Equipment) is a protective barrier that makes us signal, hurt and sweat ourselves into a faint, but it is also a barrier that prevents you from touching, hugging, comforting and spending time with your patients.

You have to be in the rooms as little as possible, because the workload does not allow it, and because with a PPE you have to spend a limited time, doing what is most important for each patient.

Knowing that there is care you cannot give your patients hurts more than the nose sores that mask and glasses produce for 8-10 hours

We continue to prioritize and fight against the clock, against the clockwork of our bodies and against that professionalism that lets you know that there is care and attention that you cannot give to your patients. Believe me, that hurts more than the nose sores that mask and glasses produce for 8-10 hours.

Every shift I see women who break when no one is looking, who cry and die of fear; colleagues who say, "I can't take it anymore" and who are up and down the hall with PID every minute, with an energy and professionalism that makes your hair stand on end.

What pride in their profession, what pride in being a woman and belonging to this wonderful guild. We are all commenting that the hardest and most difficult thing is not being able to embrace.

To embrace the patient who suffers; to embrace the patient in his last moments; to embrace the families and accompany them in their mourning; to embrace the companions in those few moments when they break down and cry; to embrace our children, couples, parents, friends...
